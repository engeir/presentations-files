# Introduction

-	Introduce the topic, e.g. something about equilibrium climate sensitivity
-   Why volcanoes rather than solar or other forcing agents?
-	Volcanoes produce large fluctuations over a short amount of time
-	How is this different form other studies? *Non-parametric approach*

# Model

-	Introduce the methodology
    -	FPP
    -	R-L deconvolution

# Method

-	Introduce data sets
    -   NorESM
    -   Jones and Mann / Crowley
    -   PAGES2k
-	Explain how response function was obtained in practice, different versions
    with different amplitude etc.
-   Explain the convolution to get back to temperature time series

# Results

-	Present estimated temperature time series from last two millennia
-	Same but in the case of a 4xCO2 experiment

# Discussion

-	See that it is possible to obtain a response function from a non-parametric approach
-	Able to reproduce historic temperature based on forcing data
-	Power spectral density of residuals fit nicely to the PSD of a control run

# Future work

-   Analysis of the shape of the response function. Reasonable fits:
    exponentials or power laws
-   More exact study of the 4xCO2 experiment
-   Estimation of the shape through the deconvolution algorithm using our own
    climate simulations
